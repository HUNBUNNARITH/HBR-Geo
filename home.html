    <h1>Protected Areas in Kratie Province, Cambodia</h1>
    <p><strong>Kratie Province</strong> in Cambodia is renowned for its natural beauty, particularly along the Mekong River. This rich biodiversity has led to the establishment of several protected areas to conserve the region's unique ecosystems.</p>

    <h2>Key Protected Areas</h2>
    <p>While specific details about the exact boundaries and management of these areas might be limited, here's an overview of the primary protected areas in Kratie:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mekong River</strong>: Although not an officially designated protected area, the Mekong River itself is a vital ecosystem supporting diverse flora and fauna. Kratie's stretch of the river is particularly known for its Irrawaddy dolphins, a critically endangered species.</li>
        <li><strong>Potential Wildlife Sanctuaries and Multiple Use Areas</strong>: There have been discussions and proposals to establish additional protected areas in Kratie, such as wildlife sanctuaries and multiple use areas. These initiatives aim to safeguard the province's biodiversity and support sustainable development.</li>
    </ul>
